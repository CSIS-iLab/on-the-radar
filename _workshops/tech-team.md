**Project Background**

This project provides an assessment of how emerging technologies are rapidly reshaping U.S. strategic situational awareness against a range of potential adversaries and examines the implications of these technologies for strategic stability. For the purposes of this study, strategic situational awareness (strategic SA) is understood to be the ability to characterize the operating environment, detect and respond to attacks, and discern actual attacks from false alarms across the spectrum of conflict, both conventional and nuclear. Strategic stability is understood as the lack of incentive to use nuclear weapons (crisis stability) and the lack of incentives to build up a nuclear arsenal (arms race stability).

Traditionally, developments that improved strategic SA were by-and-large considered stabilizing; for instance, improved early warning capabilities could help countries distinguish between a nuclear attack and a false alarm. However, recent technological trends may create destabilizing aspects to overall strategic SA improvements. Emerging strategic SA technologies are increasingly dual-use, risking turning once-strong nuclear firebreaks into dangerous tripwires. Additionally, new technologies are increasingly diverse and multi-nodal, resulting in a crowded strategic SA environment prone to miscalculation and misperception. Dangerously, increases in the quality and quantity of information gathered and processed might be enabling a shift from reactive/confirmative surveillance to predictive analysis, drastically shortening reaction times and contributing to risks of inadvertent escalation. As a result, the emerging strategic SA ecosystem is dramatically more capable, but potentially more vulnerable and disruptive.

**Game Background**

**_Introduction_**

It’s 2025 -- The U.S.-North Korea relationship has reverted to an uneasy deterrent relationship after the high-profile summits of 2018-2019 failed to yield concrete progress on denuclearization.

In 2024, a conservative coalition government came to power in South Korea after a narrow vote, leading to the suspension of all ROK-DPRK summits and the return to unsteady inter-Korean relations. International sanctions have by and large prevented Kim Jong Un from achieving the rejuvenation of the North Korean economy. United States and allied intelligence agencies believe that Kim Jong Un is facing increasing internal pressure because of the economic situation within the country. There has been an increase of North Korean sophisticated ransomware cyberattacks against South Korea in the last year, and particularly in the last few months.

The United States maintains tripwire forces in South Korea, including about 28,000 troops. Since the move of U.S. Force Korea headquarters south to Camp Humphreys in 2019, the majority of these troops are stationed there. The United States also has multiple squadrons of F-16 fighters and A-10 ground-attack jets. U.S.-ROK military exercises were resumed in 2021 (after being suspended in 2019). The South Korean coalition government has proposed an increased military budget, devoting significant resources to air and missile defense systems. However, some members of parliament are actively opposing the proposal.

Over the past six years, the DPRK has continued to produce fissile material and now possesses between 40 and 100 nuclear warheads. North Korea has advanced their naval capabilities, but it is unclear whether they have submarine-launched ballistic missile capability. The DPRK continues to conduct a range of its missile testing but has refrained from an ICBM test launch. The United States and allied intelligence communities are divided on the survivability and accuracy of the North Korean ICBM re-entry vehicle. The intelligence community believes that North Korea still relies on liquid fuel for its longer-range missiles, which take up to two hours to fuel once removed from their underground storage facilities. However, the United States and South Korea would have extremely limited warning of short-range missile attacks.

North Korea maintains a military of about 1.2 million active-duty troops with 7.7 million reserve troops. The army is equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, artillery weapons, rocket launchers and ground-to-ground missile launchers. The intelligence community estimates that North Korea possesses fewer than 100 short-range ballistic missile launchers, fewer than 100 medium-range ballistic missile launchers, and fewer than 50 intermediate-range ballistic missile launchers. It is undetermined how many intercontinental ballistic missile launchers North Korea has; however, analysts posit the number to be less than 20. North Korea has surface combat ships, amphibious ships, and submarines. North Korea’s air force is the weakest branch of its military, still largely un-modernized and consisting of old aircraft.

North Korea has a longstanding chemical weapons program with the capability to produce nerve, blister, blood, and choking agents and likely possesses a CW stockpile. North Korea can employ CW agents by modifying a variety of conventional munitions, including artillery and ballistic missiles. North Korean forces are also trained to operate in a contaminated environment. North Korea continues to research bacterial and viral biological agents that could support an offensive biological weapons program. North Korea poses a challenge to the U.S. intelligence community. Not only are North Korean military facilities geographically dispersed, the majority of North Korea’s soldiers and army equipment is moved through underground tunnels, making it difficult to monitor movement.

**_U.S. Strategic Situational Awareness Capabilities_**\[^1\]

The United States has extensive and mature strategic situational awareness capabilities across all domains (air, land, maritime, space, and cyber) that help to characterize the operating environment, detect and responds to attacks, and discern actual attacks from false alarms across the spectrum of conflict, both conventional and nuclear. The U.S. military has always relied on these capabilities at the strategic level, but over the last thirty to forty years these capabilities have increasingly become more important at the tactical and operational level as technological advances have enabled more granular tracking and detection of enemy forces and communications and coordination between different sensors and shooters to devastating effect. This combination of situational awareness capabilities across all three levels of war and all domains has provided the United States unrivaled strategic situational awareness and has become a lynchpin of U.S. military doctrine and planning.

The United States’ military superiority does not come from any singular weapon system or platform, but its ability to integrate multiple C4ISR capabilities into a systems-of-systems approach that translates strategic situational awareness into kinetic and non-kinetic fires. The Navy’s CEC/NFIC-CA capability is perhaps the best example of how several strategic situational awareness systems, sensors, and platforms are integrated into a reconnaissance-strike complex with potentially devastating effect. If the United States wanted to target an adversary’s capital ships it could send a stealthy F-35 to penetrate the enemy’s air defense undetected and relay the enemy’s location back to the carrier strike group, who could then fire long-range anti-surface missiles at the enemy’s capital ship without needing to get close.

Military capabilities do not develop in a vacuum and just as U.S. military planners recognized the value of integrating multiple systems, sensors, and platforms into a reconnaissance-strike complex, so too have American competitors. The Chinese and Russians in particular have developed sophisticated A2/AD capabilities that threaten to disrupt, degrade, or destroy essential U.S. C4ISR enabling capabilities. These advances have forced military planners to re-think fundamental assumptions from the last thirty years about the near-guaranteed availability of C4ISR capabilities. Instead of establishing theatre-wide strategic situational awareness superiority (i.e. U.S. operations in the 1991 Gulf War or Afghanistan and Iraq), the United States might only be capable of establishing temporary windows of C4ISR superiority for U.S. forces to operate from. U.S. military forces would work within these temporary windows of superiority to dis-integrate enemy A2/AD systems and eventually re-establish theatre-wide strategic situational awareness superiority, but this requires fundamental changes in the way U.S. training, doctrine, and force structures.

**_North Korea’s Strategic Situational Awareness Capabilities_**\[^2\]

Unclassified sources contain little information on North Korea’s C4ISR capabilities or strategic thinking. According to Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., an internationally recognized North Korea analyst, the country’s leadership has expressed interest in SIGINT, EW, and asymmetric warfare since at least the armistice of the Korean War, in which Kim Il Sung constituted SIGINT and COMINT abilities within the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Reconnaissance Bureau for use against both foreign and domestic enemies.\[^3\]

North Korean-origin cyber-attacks have also grown in sophistication over the last decade. According to South Korean intelligence agencies, North Korean cyber operations between 2005 and 2007 mainly stole data and documents from South Korean government agencies through individual email accounts or agency websites.\[^4\] In 2005, South Korean National Intelligence Agency found North Korean documents that ordered Lab 110 to “develop a hacking program to destroy the South’s communication network and disguise the source of attack.”\[^5\] These attacks were generally seen as rudimentary and simple.\[^6\]

Since 2008, around the time that Kim Jong Un was seen as heir apparent, North Korea’s cyber-attack capabilities developed drastically.\[^7\] North Korea’s cyber-attacks started to focus around large-scale operations using various complex malware.\[^8\] As North Korea’s capabilities expanded, so did the range of targets: North Korean hackers have targeted government employees and institutions, researchers, cryptocurrency exchanges, banks, and media worldwide.\[^9\] Until 2015, North Korean cyber-attacks focused primarily on US and South Korean government and financial organizations.\[^10\] However, in early 2016, North Korean hackers attempted to transfer $951 million from the Bangladesh Central Bank, the first of several subsequent attacks on banks around the world in 2017.\[^11\] American cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike assesses the speed of the North Korean hackers to be second only to Russian intrusion groups and superior to the Chinese.\[^12\]

Academic publications by North Korean universities can provide helpful, if incomplete, insights into R&D activities at North Korean educational institutions. The challenge with reviewing academic literature, however, is that it is not clear how the knowledge possessed in these papers are being used within North Korea. Research on reforestation, for example, might be applied to mitigate flood damage often experienced in North Korea, or it might be applied to camouflaging missile bases.

Open source reports have detailed alleged incidents of North Korean GPS jamming and spoofing dating back to 2010. In particular, North Korea is known to use its GPS jamming capabilities against South Korea, disrupting air traffic at Incheon and Gimpo International Airports. According to a report the South Korean National Assembly’s Science, Technology, Broadcasting and Communications Committee received from the Central Radio Management Agency, there were four GPS jamming and spoofing attacks tied to North Korea between 2010 to 2016.[^13](www.ddaily.co.kr/news/article/?no=160576)

**Scenario**

**_Recent Events_**

Ten days ago, North Korea seized several South Korean fishing vessels that it claimed were operating in North Korean waters. Three days later, North Korean forces attacked Baengnyeong Island, establishing _de facto_ control of the island. South Korean Forces defended the island long enough to evacuate most personnel, however 50 South Korean Marines were taken hostage.

A North Korean communique accused the new ROK government of “betraying the principals of the ROK-DPRK agreements of the last five years” and issued four demands:

· The immediate lifting of sanctions

· Cash transfers to North Korea

· Recognition of the more southerly Inter-Korean Maritime Demarcation Line in place of the internationally recognized Northern Limit Line

· The signing of a peace treaty and removal of U.S. forces from South Korea

**Your Role and Task**

**_Technology Team_**

You are a government official in an interagency group representing technical and operational expertise including that of DOD and the IC community. There are no individual roles within the group. The National Security Advisor has convened this group of technical experts to provide options to improve U.S. situational awareness of the developing North Korea crisis.

You will review a series of options to improve situational awareness (“a collection plan”) prepared by your staff and decide, unanimously if possible, which actions should be taken immediately. You may add some options that you feel are missing, but due to time constraints, you will not be able to overhaul the entire collection plan. You will brief the policy team on what actions you have taken to improve situational awareness.

There may be options in the collection plan that introduce high levels of operational, technical or political risk. You should brief these options to the policy team and seek guidance on whether, and how, these options should be used. While you should be prepared to discuss the risks associated with these options, it is the policymakers’ job to approve/disapprove the options based on the perceived risk.
