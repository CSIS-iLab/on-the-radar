##### Introduction

For most of the nuclear age, enhanced strategic situational awareness (SA)—the ability to characterize the operating environment, detect attacks of strategic significance (whether conventional or nuclear), and discern real attacks from false alarms—has been viewed as an unqualified benefit to strategic stability.[^1] By improving the accuracy and timeliness of warning, increasing visibility and clarity as to adversary actions, and extending decision time in crisis, enhanced situational awareness reduces the risk of miscalculation and alleviates use or lose pressure that could incentivize a nuclear first strike. Moreover, for the conventional war fight information dominance had no imaginable downsides. But can there be too much of a good thing?

Today, potential and existing technology offers the prospect of previously unimaginable visibility into adversary actions and intentions. The combination of new sensor technologies, platforms for their deployment, high-bandwidth networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) tools are transforming the potential field of view at the conventional and strategic levels of conflict. As the strategic SA ecosystem evolves, it is becoming increasingly possible that actions to improve strategic SA may actually _increase_ the risk of escalation and upset strategic stability. On the other hand, concerns about escalation may cause reluctance among decision-makers to use capabilities that could better illuminate a crisis and reduce the risk and consequences of war.

The transformational nature of this emerging strategic SA landscape suggests a re-look is necessary to consider the risks and challenges of these emerging capabilities, especially when employed between nuclear-armed states in crisis or conflict. To effectively manage crisis escalation, decisionmakers must understand the changing relationship between mechanistic improvements to strategic SA and crisis stability.

##### The Traditional Strategic Situational Awareness Environment (1950-1990)

The traditional strategic SA environment was first developed during the Cold War and was focused on understanding an adversary’s nuclear systems and nuclear force posture. It consisted of early warning radars and satellites, as well as hydrophones to detect ballistic missile submarines. Specific systems in the traditional environment included the Defense Support Program (DSP) Satellites, the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), and the Navy’s sound surveillance system, or SOSUS.[^2] Together, these systems were central to providing situational awareness in the nuclear domain.

These passive systems, as well as other systems in the traditional strategic SA environment, were viewed as stabilizing—designed to detect attacks, not to predict them. For example, early warning radars detected incoming missiles after they were launched; they were able to alert decisionmakers that an attack was incoming but could not provide enough warning to prevent an attack. Furthermore, systems in the traditional strategic SA environment often passively received information instead of actively seeking it out. For example, SOSUS was comprised of hydrophones that were fixed on the ocean floor. These hydrophones could detect an adversary submarine as it that passed their location but could not actively roam the ocean to find or track adversary assets.

Furthermore, the traditional strategic SA ecosystem was stratified. During the Cold War, strategic SA capabilities were almost exclusively focused on collecting information on nuclear systems. Conventional assets, which were not yet capable of posing a strategic threat, were monitored in times of conflict by tactical SA capabilities like manned aircraft.[^3] The bright line between systems used for nuclear and conventional SA reduced the possibility that inadvertent escalation due to entanglement of nuclear and conventional systems would occur.

The clear line between SA systems used for conventional and nuclear missions also meant that strategic SA assets were secure and compartmentalized. Operating at in space or remote geographic locations, these systems were traditionally difficult to target kinetically. Other parts of the strategic SA system, such as command and control, contained substantial redundancies and were expected to survive even a nuclear attack. Moreover, in the traditional SA environment, countries would have limited incentives to target strategic SA systems in a conventional conflict, as doing so would not limit an adversary’s ability to conduct conventional operations.[^4] As such, if an adversary did target strategic SA systems, the attack would likely be interpreted as a precursor to a nuclear attack, inviting immediate nuclear retaliation. Hence these systems have traditionally been considered off limits to attackers.

Generally speaking, the secure and compartmentalized nature of the traditional SA environment led to high confidence in the information these systems provided, limited their vulnerability to attack and manipulation, and reduced the chances of miscalculation. As a result, these systems came to be viewed as contributing positively to strategic stability by ensuring confidence in the durability of the overall nuclear deterrent and reducing risks of premature or miscalculated nuclear use.

##### The Transitional Strategic SA Environment (1990-2020)

In the traditional SA environment, critical warning-related information could be obtained without incurring significant escalatory risk, specifically, without driving parties closer to the nuclear brink. However, the security and strategic SA environments have changed dramatically in the last two decades, potentially upsetting past assumptions about the compartmentalization of nuclear and conventional SA systems and the stabilizing nature of transparency.

The security and strategic SA environments are being transformed primarily by three key trends: the rapid pace of technological innovation, the increasing likelihood of conflict at the conventional and sub-conventional level between nuclear armed states, and the increasingly dual-use[^5] nature of military and surveillance technology across all levels of conflict. Critically, whereas the traditional strategic SA environment contained systems that were either focused on nuclear warning (“nuclear” strategic SA systems) or on providing intelligence to commanders about the conventional battlefield (“conventional” strategic SA systems), in the transitional strategic SA environment, dual-use strategic SA capabilities may be tasked to conduct both missions.

The beginnings of this dynamic can be traced back to the 1990s and the end of the Cold War. Technological developments throughout the second half of the 20th century culminated in the networked battlefield of the Gulf War. The Gulf War saw the employment of effective communications, command, control and intelligence (C3I) which gave commanders dramatically improved situational awareness by making use of strategic systems for conventional purposes—especially in terms of precision targeting. For example, satellite systems were fully employed to give commanders in the field intelligence regarding the adversary’s troop locations, air defense and command and control installations.

The reliance on strategic SA assets in conventional conflicts is only intensifying in the transitional strategic SA environment. Advanced, long-range, and often dual-use missile systems have proliferated dramatically in recent decades, including among a range of nuclear-armed adversaries, and now must figure significantly into planning and execution of conventional conflicts. This means that adversaries may have strong incentives to target nuclear warning systems early in a crisis in order to ensure conventional dominance. However, as James Acton has argued, this type of action could easily lead the victim to believe that a nuclear strike against them was imminent, and to escalation because of this “misinterpreted warning.”[^6]

At the same time, countries have invested in SA capabilities that were designed for conventional missions but may have utility for nuclear ones. For example, the Global Hawk was initially intended “to support joint combatant forces in worldwide peacetime, contingency and wartime operations.”[^7] However, as Keir Lieber and Daryl Press suggest, UAVs like the Global Hawk may also be useful to track a small country’s nuclear-tipped mobile missiles.[^8] This and other dual-use capabilities contribute to the blurring of lines between the conventional and nuclear sphere.

The blurring between the nuclear and conventional SA spaces is particularly dangerous because the likelihood of both conventional conflict and sub-conventional activities between nuclear-armed adversaries is growing. Nuclear-armed states are relying more on gray zone tactics such as economic coercion, cyber techniques, proxy forces, terrorism and information operations to achieve their geopolitical goals. At the same time, conflict dynamics in Syria, Ukraine, Kashmir, the Korean Peninsula, the Baltics, Taiwan, the South China Sea, and Doklam all demonstrate the potential for conventional conflict between nuclear-armed states. In both sub-conventional and conventional conflicts, nuclear armed states will rely on SA tools to gain an advantage. However, the increasingly interdependent, dual-use nature of the SA ecosystem means that the SA space may provide an unrecognized or unexpected pathway to nuclear escalation.

##### The Emerging Strategic Situational Awareness Environment (2020 forward)

The emerging strategic SA environment will be even more networked, dual-use and codependent than the transitional one. Distinctions or firebreaks between conventional and strategic situational awareness will all but disappear, creating a highly networked, real-time, dual-use landscape that is both murkier and more complex across all levels of conflict—sub-conventional, conventional, and strategic.

The blurring of lines between the conventional and strategic domains will only intensify as new SA systems come online. In the emerging SA environment, not only will conventional weapons rely on strategic SA assets for targeting data, countries will also rely on traditionally conventional systems for strategic warning. For example, hypersonic systems, boost-glide systems, long-range cruise missiles and other capabilities are designed to elude traditional U.S. early warning systems (i.e. radars and satellites) and thus defeat U.S. missile defenses. To counter these new delivery systems, the United States may have to rely on conventional situational awareness systems, including systems that are more visible or intrusive, to complete strategic missions and supplement strategic SA. If an adversary were to discover and target such systems, would such an attack be considered conventional or strategic in intent and implication? As such, the days of clear delineations between strategic and conventional situational awareness capabilities in ways that contribute to a sharp firebreak between conventional and strategic conflict seem limited at best.

Similarly, increasingly blurred lines between nuclear and conventional command, control, and communications also contribute to this dynamic. Conventional missile warning currently relies on these dual-use surveillance capabilities, increasing the risk that they could be targeted in a conventional conflict for conventional purposes but with profound strategic implications. For example, an attack by an adversary on an early warning system used to provide warning for both nuclear and conventional attacks could very well be interpreted as a precursor to a nuclear attack, regardless of the intent.

Moving forward, the highly networked nature of conventional systems, as well as the dual-capable nature of many of them, may increase the potential for conflict to bleed from the conventional into the nuclear realm. In the emerging strategic situational awareness ecosystem, there will be ample potential for inadvertent escalation through miscalculation. By employing an invasive capability to collect information on an adversary’s systems, actions, or intent, the very nature of that collection could trigger an unwanted response. For example, deploying unmanned underwater vehicles into a known port in an attempt to gauge whether an adversary is flushing its nuclear submarines might make an adversary suspect intent to target its sea-based deterrent, and thereby lead to a nuclear escalation. There are a number of technologies and capabilities that are contributing to the emerging environment, but each brings unique advantages and risks.
