Improvements to strategic situational awareness (SSA) – the ability to characterize the operating environment, detect and respond to threats, and discern actual attacks from false alarms across the spectrum of conflict – have long been assumed to reduce the risk of conflict and allow for the more successful management of crisis and conflict when they occur. In nuclear policy jargon such impacts are considered “stabilizing” because they reduce the risk of escalation to higher levels of violence. However, with the rapid development of increasingly capable SSA-related technology, the growing co-mingling of conventional and strategic SSA requirements and capabilities, and an increasing risk of conventional conflict between nuclear armed adversaries, this may no longer be the case.

Emerging technology may be transforming the SSA space from a relatively passive and secure realm with clear firebreaks between conventional and nuclear systems to an ecosystem that is much more active, dual-use, and crowded. The emerging SSA ecosystem may be dramatically more capable, but potentially more vulnerable and disruptive as well.

In light of these dynamics, the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Nuclear Policy Working Group at the University of California, Berkeley, have launched a two-year long project to study the impact of emerging technologies that affect situational awareness on strategic stability. In addition to producing analysis on these issues, the project will engage and support next generation researchers by involving them directly in research and providing them with opportunities and forums – including this website – to engage and collaborate across communities.

The site, On the Radar, serves as a platform to report analysis and findings, share resources, and involve a diverse group of experts in the project. Here, users will find primers on individual technologies, analysis of specific countries’ SSA capabilities, and interactive tools to explore the projects’ analysis and assessments. The website will also host a comprehensive database of relevant work on emerging technology and strategic stability.

_This project was made possible by the Carnegie Corporation of New York. All views expressed on the website should be understood to be solely those of the authors._

### About PONI

{% include about-aside.html %}

The core mission of PONI is to develop the next generation of policy, technical, and operational nuclear professionals by fostering, sustaining, and convening a networked community of young professionals prepared to meet the nuclear challenges of the future.

PONI works to achieve this mission through several objectives:

* Identifying emerging thought leaders and providing them with the opportunity to develop and present new concepts and ideas.
* Sponsoring new cutting-edge research.
* Encouraging thoughtful and informed debate.
* Engaging a broad and diverse community across the country and internationally.
* Providing a networked platform for information-sharing and collaboration across the broad nuclear community.
* Cultivating young professionals through opportunities to build relationships, deepen understanding, and share perspectives across the full range of nuclear issues and communities.

### About the Nuclear Policy Working Group

The Nuclear Policy Working Group (NPWG) is a research-based educational programming effort that provides opportunities for students from a variety of fields to conduct multidisciplinary research on topics in nonproliferation and nuclear security. The NPWG has a three-fold mission: (1) to educate students on contemporary issues in nuclear security, (2) to foster collaboration across the technical and social science fields, and (3) to generate original policy-relevant publications. The group strives to minimizes knowledge gaps across disciplines by providing relevant material to participants through interactive seminars and events hosted throughout the academic year.
