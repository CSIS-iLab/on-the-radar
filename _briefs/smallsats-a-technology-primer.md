* Small satellites (smallsats) are miniaturized artificial satellites with a mass less than 500 kg used for communication, imaging, and other space applications.
* These relatively low-cost “disposable” space assets can be deployed in a constellation, providing increased redundancy and resiliency against counterspace threats.
* Smallsats can enhance situational awareness (SA) by providing advanced, low-cost sensing of in-orbit space objects, and by delivering persistent broad-coverage Earth imaging for a variety of conventional and nuclear missions.
* Overall, smallsats can provide significant enhancements to situational awareness missions, however, their vulnerability to detection and even disruption means that their impressive SA capabilities could potentially undermine stability in some contexts.
