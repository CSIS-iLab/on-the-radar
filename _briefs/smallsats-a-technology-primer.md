excerpt: "* Small satellites (smallsats) are miniaturized artificial satellites with
  a mass less than 500 kg used for communication, imaging, and other space applications.\n*
  These relatively low-cost “disposavble” space assets can be deployed in a constellation,
  providing increased redundancy and resiliency against counterspace threats. \n*
  Smallsats can enhance situational awareness (SA) by providing advanced, low-cost
  sensing of in-orbit space objects, and by delivering persistent broad-coverage Earth
  imaging for a variety of conventional and nuclear missions.\n* Overall, smallsats
  can provide significant enhancements to situational awareness missions, however,
  their vulnerability to detection and even disruption means that their impressive
  SA capabilities could potentially undermine stability in some contexts."
