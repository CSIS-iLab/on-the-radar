title: North Korea's Strategic Situational Awareness Capabilities
date: 2020-06-01 04:00:00 +0000
excerpt: This report attempts to leverage publicly available information to (a) contextualize
  North Korea’s current intelligence organizations and operational doctrine within
  the context of its historical development; and (b) detail the capabilities, military
  assets, and battlefield systems that North Korea currently uses to achieve and develop
  strategic situational awareness.

North Korea’s developing strategic situational awareness (SA) capabilities incorporate technologies that could introduce new risks in a conflict or crisis on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea possesses multifaceted command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems that support a range of provocative asymmetric operations, including but not limited to GPS jamming, communications spoofing, cyberespionage, and cyberattacks.[^1] While North Korea has rapidly developed its domestic telecommunications infrastructure and advanced computing capability in recent years, its systems continue to face technical and operational limitations that may constrain North Korea’s SA in engagements across the spectrum of conflict.

This report synthesizes publicly available information on North Korea’s C4ISR systems and capabilities in order to consider how technology could affect escalatory dynamics or crisis stability during conflict in East Asia. The author prioritized primary sources from North Korean institutions or companies, official reports from governments, technical reports from specialist research firms, and articles from English-, Korean-, and Chinese-language media.[^2] Wherever possible, the author also attempted to corroborate information across multiple sources in different languages. Because the public domain contains little information on North Korea’s C4ISR equipment, readers are advised that the findings in this report likely provide an incomplete view of North Korea’s strategic SA capabilities, which therefore limits the scope of conclusions that readers should draw about the effect that these technologies may have in conflict.[^3] Nonetheless, this report represents a broad review of literature on North Korea’s approach to emerging technologies and should be of interest to policymakers and informed observers who wish to consider the relationship between technology and strategic stability on the Korean Peninsula.
