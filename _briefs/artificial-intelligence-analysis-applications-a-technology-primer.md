title: 'Artificial Intelligence Analysis Applications: A Technology Primer'
date: 2019-04-03 04:00:00 +0000
excerpt: "* Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have the potential to significantly
  impact the strategic situational awareness (strategic SA) mission in two key areas—operations
  and analysis. While autonomous operations of platforms, sensors, and cyber strategic
  SA collection assets have their own sets of risks and benefits, which this project
  addresses in other primers, this primer focuses on the AI applications that enhance
  the strategic SA mission through improving analysis.\n\nAI analysis applications
  can enhance the strategic SA mission by employing data mining, data fusion methods,
  front-line analysis, and predictive analytics.  \n\nEach of these methods of enhancing
  strategic SA has synergies with one another that build on each other and further
  enhance strategic SA. Taken together, these capabilities can unlock and increase
  the significant potential for speed, precision, and persistence inherent in the
  emerging strategic SA “ecosystem” without sacrificing vantage or undetectability.
  The resilience/reliability of these capabilities is dependent on both the resiliency
  of the collection platform or method and the reliability of the algorithms underlying
  the AI application.   \n\nThe potential for AI analysis tools to provide predictive
  and preemptive strategic SA could enable actions that undermine strategic stability.
  The clandestine, vulnerable, and dual-use nature of AI analysis applications could
  further undermine strategic stability by increasing the chance of misperception,
  miscalculation, and inadvertent escalation."
