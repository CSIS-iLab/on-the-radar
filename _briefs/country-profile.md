**Introduction**

The United States has extensive and mature strategic situational awareness capabilities across all domains (air, land, maritime, space, and cyber) that help to characterize the operating environment, detect and respond to attacks, and discern actual attacks from false alarms across the spectrum of conflict, both conventional and nuclear. The U.S. military has always relied on these capabilities at the strategic level, but over the last thirty to forty years these capabilities have increasingly become more important at the tactical and operational level as technological advances have enabled more granular tracking and detection of enemy forces and communications and coordination between different sensors and shooters to devastating effect. This combination of situational awareness capabilities across all three levels of war and all domains has provided the United States unrivaled strategic situational awareness and has become a lynchpin of U.S. military doctrine and planning. However, the enemy gets a vote, and potential adversaries like China and Russia have focused on enhancing their own strategic situational awareness capabilities and developing ways to disrupt, degrade, and destroy U.S. strategic situational awareness.

Historical Developments The origin of the United States’ current situational awareness capabilities largely traces back to the Cold War and the arms race between the Soviet Union and the United States. Over the course of the Cold War, the United States’ strategic situational awareness capacities evolved as the Soviet challenge changed. Initially, U.S. strategic situational awareness efforts focused on monitoring and evaluating the Soviet’s nuclear development program. As the Soviets achieved nuclear parity and U.S. doctrine switched from Eisenhower’s massive retaliation to Kennedy’s flexible-response, early-warning alerts and surveillance and reconnaissance of Soviet nuclear forces became U.S. priorities. [\[1\]](#_ftn1) During the mid-1970s, U.S. strategic situational awareness capabilities evolved again as shifts in the conventional military balance [\[2\]](#_ftn2) and U.S.-Soviet nuclear parity necessitated the U.S. develop ways to “use U.S. technological advantages to offset the quantitative advantage of Soviet forces.”[\[3\]](#_ftn3) Under the leadership of Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Bill Perry, the U.S. focused on developing three main capabilities: command, control, communications, and intelligence; defense suppression (stealth); and precision guidance. Combined in a                                             system-of-systems approach, these three capabilities formed a reconnaissance-strike complex in which tactical intelligence from several sensors flowed into an integrated C&C system which pushed that collective data to ‘shooters’ equipped with precision-guided munitions (PGMs) to enable a degree of precision never before seen.

At the end of the Cold War, the success of the Second Offset’s reconnaissance-strike complex in the 1991 Gulf War drove an insatiable demand for increasingly expansive command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) capabilities integrated into an increasingly networked architecture of high-tech sensors and shooters. The demand for C4ISR capabilities and capacities only increased during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as the permissive threat environment and technological advances, such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS), created new intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) paradigms and demands. However, in more recent years DoD has turned its attention towards the challenges that Russia and Chinese advances in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities pose for the United States strategic situational awareness.

Air Domain The United States has extensive aerial situational awareness capabilities at both the strategic and operational level.  Strategic: Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance  The United States operates several manned and unmanned ISR aircraft that perform a range of strategic intelligence functions ranging from collecting signals intelligence (SIGINT), to monitoring potential ballistic missile launches to collecting radar and imagery intelligence from the newest advanced sensors. These aircraft generally fall into three categories: large, manned reconnaissance aircraft; manned ultra-high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft; and high-altitude long endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial systems.

The United States Air Force (USAF) operates a family of large, manned reconnaissance aircraft (RC-135) that collect and disseminate critical intelligence that helps military planners characterize the operational environment and detect ballistic missile launches. The family of RC-135s are roughly similar in size and shape to Boeing’s 707 commercial airliner and are equipped with specialized radars, antennas, data links, and other electronic suites that collect and disseminate vital measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT), and signals intelligence.[\[4\]](#_ftn4) The RC-135 family provides military planners two primary advantages over other strategic situational awareness platforms. First, while the U.S. operates space-based systems that collect similar intelligence, these platforms are limited by orbital constraints compared to the RC135 aircraft, which can be more rapidly deployed and employed dynamically in response to emerging crisis situations. Second, in addition to the pilot and navigator, the family of RC-135 aircraft are operated by a flight crew comprising electronic warfare officers, airborne systems engineers, and intelligence/mission area specialists that can analyze and disseminate the data as its gathered. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) seizure of U.S. Navy sailors in 2016 offers a perfect study of the advantages the RC-135 family of aircraft brings over other systems. An RC-135 V/W had been planning on conducting a mission over Afghanistan, but as the situation developed, the plane was deployed to instead monitor the IRGC forces. Furthermore, intelligence analysts aboard the RC-135 were able to evaluate the Iranian’s intentions in real-time after the IRGC kept shifting the drop off location due to bad weather.[\[5\]](#_ftn5)

The United States only operates one manned ultra-high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft platform, the U-2 Dragon Lady. Operating at over 70,000 feet, the U-2 is a manned, multi-mission aircraft that can be configured to provide radar and hyperspectral imagery, SIGINT, or MASINT. Depending on its configuration, the U-2 can carry either the radar imagery collector Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System-2 (ASARS-2), Senior Glass ELINT suite, the long-range hyperspectral Senior Year Electro-Optical Reconnaissance System 2 (SYERS-2), or the optical bar camera that captures wide-angle imagery.[\[6\]](#_ftn6) While the U-2 operates at 70,000 feet, it is vulnerable to enemy air defense systems.

In addition to its manned reconnaissance aircraft, the U.S. operates unmanned HALE aircraft like the RQ-4 Global Hawk and RQ-180.  The RQ-4 Global Hawk is an unmanned, multi-missioned HALE platform that can be configured to provide imagery and signals intelligence, as well as collecting moving target indicator (MTI) data. The RQ-4 Global Hawk offers similar high-altitude surveillance capabilities as the U-2 Dragon Lady but is able to loiter and offer persistent surveillance for up to 34-hour plus. However, just like the U-2 Dragon Lady, the RQ-4 Global Hawk is vulnerable to enemy air defense systems.[\[7\]](#_ftn7)

Finally, the RQ-180 Sentinel is a classified, low-observable UAS platform designed to be a ‘global strike enabler’ in contested or ‘denied’ airspaces. Though its specifications are classified, the RQ-180 is likely capable of both active and passive electronic surveillance and electronic attack.[\[8\]](#_ftn8) Furthermore, the RQ-180 is likely to have the capability to detect nuclear activity given that its predecessor, the RQ-170 Sentinel, is reported to have surveilled Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran’s nuclear programs.[\[9\]](#_ftn9)  Finally, the RQ-180 is rumored to have 24-hour endurance and a range of 1,200 nautical miles, but it is unknown whether the RQ-180 has an in-flight refueling capability to extend that range. Operational Theatre Battlefield Management The United States operates several manned airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) capabilities that help detect and track enemy aircraft and ground targets, coordinate theatre air campaigns, and serve as data relays for ground forces. The USAF’s E-8 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) detects and tracks enemy aircraft up-to 200 miles away.  Air battle managers on-board coordinate theatre air operations. The United States Navy (USN) E-2 Hawkeye fulfills a similar mission set for the carrier strike group. E-8 JSTARS provides ground moving target indicator (GMTI) data to support theatre ground operations. Finally, the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) payload, equipped on both manned and unmanned platforms, enables beyond line-of-sight data relay and communications between troops on the ground and other airborne platforms.[\[10\]](#_ftn10)  Theatre ISR  The United States employs several aircraft that perform theatre-level ISR that contribute to strategic situational awareness for both the maritime and ground domains. Of note, while not primarily ISR platforms, fighters and bombers, including the next-generation stealth aircraft F-22 Raptor, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and B-21 Raider, are increasingly important as intelligence collection platforms as they are strike platforms thanks to the addition of advanced sensors and radars on those aircraft.[\[11\]](#_ftn11)

Over the last twenty years, UAS platforms have performed extensive ground surveillance and reconnaissance given the permissive nature of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and drones’ advantages over manned platforms.[\[12\]](#_ftn12) These UAS platforms are largely medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) UAS platforms equipped with both sensors and precision-guided munition. The two main MALE UAS platforms currently in operation are the Air Force’s MQ-9 Reaper and the Army’s MQ-1C Gray Eagle.[\[13\]](#_ftn13) The MQ-9 Reaper has traditionally been operated as a theatre-level asset given that its controlled by operators out of Creech AFB, Nevada while the MQ-1C Gray Eagle can be used more tactically as it is locally controlled. Furthermore, the Army has enabled manned-unmanned teaming between the MQ-1C Gray Eagle and AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter.[\[14\]](#_ftn14) The MQ-9 Reaper and MQ-1C Gray Eagle are complimented by several light or hand-launched UAVs such as the RQ-70 Shadow and RQ-11 Raven, as well as the Army’s manned, turboprop aircraft RC-12 Guardrail which collects SIGINT.[\[15\]](#_ftn15)

The United States has several manned and unmanned platforms that perform maritime patrol and reconnaissance missions. The unmanned HALE MQ-4 Triton is the backbone of U.S. maritime reconnaissance and patrol architecture thanks to its 24-hour endurance and MULTI-INT capabilities. The MQ-4 Triton can perform not only broad area maritime surveillance (BAMS), but also detect, identify, and track surface ships and capture high-resolution images and full-motion videos thanks to its multifunction active sensor radar and electrooptical/infrared multi-spectral targeting system.[\[16\]](#_ftn16) From the persistent wide-area coverage provided by the MQ-4C Triton, platforms like the unmanned MQ-8 Fire Scout, and P-8 Poseidon aircraft are capable of more precise ISR. The MQ-8 Fire Scout is a short-range unmanned helicopter capable of operating off both ships and land that is used for real-time ISR target acquisition.[\[17\]](#_ftn17) The P-8 Poseidon is a manned, multi-mission maritime patrol and reconnaissance platform that is the world’s premier anti-submarine warfare aircraft. The P-8 is equipped with several armaments, can drop sonar buoys, and is equipped with several integrated multi-function radar systems that work together to locate, track, and kill enemy submarines.[\[18\]](#_ftn18) While the P-8 doesn’t have a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) sensor like its predecessor, the P-3 Orion, the Navy is working to develop an UAS equipped with a MAD that operates with the P-8.[\[19\]](#_ftn19)

Future: Unmanned “Swarms” The United States has multiple efforts underway to develop ‘swarming’ capabilities in which small UAVs, numbering from just a few to potentially thousands, are networked together and share information to form the swarm’s collective brain. This collective brain then autonomously controls and directs the individual UAVs comprising the swarm in pursuit of the swarm’s broader mission. If one--or several--drones are destroyed or debilitated the swarm endures as the collective brain compensates for the missing drones and re-orients itself. This ability to autonomously operate and adapt makes it perfectly suited for a number of C4ISR missions that include, but are not limited to, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance of enemy forces, spoofing and jamming of enemy EW capabilities, and potentially down the line kinetic attacks.

U.S. efforts to develop swarming capabilities are progressing along two main thrusts: disposable, air-launched micro-drones which are roughly the size of a large hand and small, re-usable airborne launched and recovered UAVs. The effort to develop disposable, air-launched micro-drones, led by the Strategic Capabilities Office, successfully tested a swarm of 103 Perdix micro-drones in October 2016. Packed into flare canisters and ejected from an F/A-18 Super Hornet, the micro-done swarm successfully “demonstrated advanced swarm behaviors such as collective decision-making, adaptive formation flying, and self-healing.”[\[20\]](#_ftn20)  The second major thrust, re-usable airborne launched and recovered UAVs, is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Gremlins program. This program seeks to develop small UAVs, Gremlins, that can be launched out of military aircraft, operate as a swarm to complete its mission, and then be recovered by a C-130 or other transport aircraft. Gremlins would be re-usable again after a 24-hour recovery period and are designed to carry a range of advanced sensors up to 150 pounds. As of January 2019, DARPA’s Gremlins program is still in development, but is progressing to a full-scale technology demonstration by the end of the year.[\[21\]](#_ftn21)  Electronic Warfare Although the United States has extensive aerial situational awareness capabilities, it has considerably less electronic warfare (EW) capabilities that can jam or disrupt adversaries’ situational awareness, particularly against a near-peer competitor like China or Russia.[\[22\]](#_ftn22) Current U.S. aerial EW capabilities are limited to the EA-18G Growler, the EC-130H Compass Call, and F-16 CM Block 50 “Wild Weasel.”[\[23\]](#_ftn23) Working together, these three aircraft perform the suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) mission by jamming enemy radar and communications and destroying them using high-speed anti-radiation missiles (HARM). The EA-18G Growler primarily detects and jams enemy radars but is also equipped with two AGM-88 HARM missiles; the EC-130H Compass Call primarily jams enemy communications, while the F-16 CM Wild Weasels primarily serve as the HARM shooters after enemy radar and communications have been destroyed. In the future, the F-35 Lightning II, with its next-generation stealth coating and minimal radar cross section, will replace the F-16 CM Wild Weasels role in SEAD missions.[\[24\]](#_ftn24)

Maritime Domain Undersea Warfare The Navy’s multi-missioned nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) provide the U.S. an asymmetric advantage over potential competitors like China and Russia. Unlike the Chinese or Russians who operate a mix of diesel-electric and nuclear-powered submarines, the U.S. submarine force is exclusively nuclear-powered which provides considerably greater speeds and endurance than their diesel counterparts. Additionally, U.S. SSNs are equipped with several advanced sensors, like the Large Aperture Bow sonar array, that enable SSNs to perform their primary mission, the hunting and killing of enemy submarines. In addition to their anti-surface warfare capabilities, SSNs perform a variety of roles that include covert ISR to include “national-level purposes,” insertion and recovery of SOF forces, covert strikes against land targets, anti-surface warfare, and anti-mine warfare.[\[25\]](#_ftn25) The U.S. currently operates three different types of attack submarines, the Virginia class, three Seawolf class SSNs, and a limited number of aging-Los Angeles submarines.[\[26\]](#_ftn26) Of special note for strategic situational awareness is the highly-secretive USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23). The last of the Seawolf-class submarines, the USS Jimmy Carter’s hull is extended 100 feet longer than the other two Seawolf-class submarines to accommodate a Multi-Mission Platform that enables a variety of missions including extensive ISR. It has been reported that the USS Jimmy Carter flew surveillance drones over North Korea in 2010 and has the capability to tap undersea communications cables.[\[27\]](#_ftn27)

The U.S. Navy operates a limited number of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV), primarily in a mine countermeasures (MCM) role, but has two major UUV developmental efforts underway: Large Diameter UUV (LDUUV) and Extra-Large UUV (XLUUV).[\[28\]](#_ftn28) Both programs are still in early development and are not expected to shift to production until the mid-2020s.[\[29\]](#_ftn29) When they first enter the fleet, the LDUUV and XLUUV will be singlemissioned platforms focused on ISR and MCM respectively, but might eventually take on broader missions.[\[30\]](#_ftn30) Surface Warfare The United States surface warfare situational awareness advantages are not due to any singular platform or radar system, but the carrier strike group’s cooperative engagement capability (CEC)/Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) capability to synthetize data from multiple sensors across the entire fleet, to include naval aviation, into a single, real-time, composite track picture of the adversary.[\[31\]](#_ftn31) The real strength is the CEC/NIFC-CA’s ability to direct any ‘shooter’ in the fleet to fire upon the common composite picture, regardless of whether that shooter’s radars could see the target or not. The CEC/NIFC-CA extends the radar range of the carrier strike group, reducing the vulnerability of individual ships to enemy EW attacks, and improves overall accuracy and situational awareness across the fleet.

Space Domain Since the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 into low earth orbit in 1957 and kicked off the Space Race, space has held a critical role in establishing global U.S. strategic situational awareness. U.S. initial space capabilities focused on missions that addressed the nuclear challenges posed by the Soviet Union:  intelligence collection on Soviet forces and capabilities, early warning launch alerts, and resilient strategic communications.[\[32\]](#_ftn32) As technology advanced, satellites took on an increasing number of missions such as high-resolution optical imaging, radar imaging, electronic intelligence, position, navigation and timing (PNT), and tactical communications, to include data relay functions.

Today, the United States enjoys a considerable advantage in the space domain over strategic competitors like China and Russia, particularly with regards to the maturity of the commercial sector. As of November 2018, the United States, including both the U.S. government and firms operating out of the United States, operate more satellites (830) than Russia (149) and China (280) combined. However, in more recent years America’s strategic competitors, particularly China, have made great strides in advancing their military space capabilities. Looking only at military satellites, the U.S. (167) still operates more satellites than either Russia (93) or China (100), but the difference is not as stark as the total for both commercial and governmental entities. Furthermore, in the absence of a strategic competitor in space at the end of the Cold War, the United States emphasized developing a small number of exquisite systems that are increasingly vulnerable to disruption and attack potentially place “too many eggs in too few baskets.”[\[33\]](#_ftn33)

The following sections describes the current and near-term U.S. space capabilities, focusing on the military services’ unclassified space capabilities. The United States has extensive classified space capabilities, particularly for the different intelligence collection missions, that fall under the purview of the Intelligence Community. These classified satellites are largely operated by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which has publicly revealed that it operates at least four different constellations: SIGINT, GEOINT, communication relay, and reconnaissance.[\[34\]](#_ftn34)  Remote Sensing and Observation The United States has substantive remote sensing and observation capabilities in space, particularly concerning the detection of ballistic missiles.

The Defense Support Program (DSP), Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), and Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) complimentarily work together to detect and track ballistic missiles through all three phases of its trajectory (boost; midcourse; terminal). DSP, the oldest of the three programs, was originally developed in the 1960s to track Soviet and Chinese ballistic missiles launches but was re-tooled during the 1991 Gulf War to track Iraqi scud missile launches. SBIRS, the follow-on program to DSP, fulfills a similar mission, but with enhanced capability. SBIRS can simultaneously examine wide territory and specific narrow areas of concern unlike the DSP which was limited to one or the other.[\[35\]](#_ref35) In addition to its primary missile detection mission, SBIRS’ infrared (IR) cameras are used to help create a “catalog of signatures— electromagnetic and IR—of aircraft, missiles and other military hardware operating globally.”[\[36\]](#_ref36) Additionally, the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), although not its primary purpose, has been upgraded to detect nuclear detonations.

Other U.S. remote sensing and observation capabilities include collecting environmental data for military weather forecasting [\[37\]](); maintaining space situational awareness through the tracking, characterizing, and measuring of orbital vehicles and debris in Earth’s orbit [\[38\]](#_ftn38); tracking and detecting foreign naval assets [\[39\]](#_ftn39); and exquisite optical and radar imaging that can see through cloud cover and penetrate soil.[\[40\]](#_ftn40) Finally, although its classified, it is likely the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) developed and operates “stealthy” satellites.[\[41\]](#_ftn41)

**Data Relay and Communications** 

The United States operates several military communications satellites (MILSATCOM) that generally fall into three main categories: wideband, protected, and narrowband. As a general rule, wideband systems generally support higher capacities, narrowband support mobile users who require low data rates, and protected systems are harder to defect, defended against jamming, and hardened against nuclear attack.42 In addition to its own communications satellites, the U.S. military enhances its communications capabilities and capacities by leasing coverage from commercial satellite providers like Iridium.43

Current U.S. wideband MILSATCOM capabilities consist primarily of the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), the Global Broadcast Service (GBS), and the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) systems. These three complimentary systems deliver global, high-capacity communications to troops on the ground, sailors at sea, policymakers, and international partners.44 The launch of the WGS 8, WGS 9, and WG10 satellites between 2017 and 2019 and the WGS 11 and WGS 12 scheduled around 2020 will add considerable wideband MILSATCOM capacity as these five satellites provide 45 percent more bandwidth than the WGS satellites already in orbit.45 Of note, both the GBS and WGS are thought to be particularly susceptible to Chinese “space-based jammers hosted on small satellites.”46

The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system and its predecessor, MILSTAR Satellite Communications System (MILSTAR), work together in an integrated architecture to provide protected, jamresistant MILSATCOM communication capabilities. AEHF and MILSTAR satellites are cross-linked, eliminating the need for ground relay stations and reducing the risks of signals being intercepted on the ground. While these satellites are protected against jamming, spoofing, and other forms of electronic attack they are vulnerable to kinetic attacks like those China and Russia have already demonstrated.47

The U.S. currently operates two narrowband MILSATCOM systems: Ultra-High Frequency Follow-On (UFO) and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). MUOS has shown great promise but has suffered from a lack of compatible terminals and vulnerability to enemy disruption. While the satellites themselves have been operational for some time, the troops on the ground lack the terminals to interface with the satellites.48 Additionally, a 2015 Navy Command Operational Test and Evaluation Force found over 1,000 cyber vulnerabilities that the MUOS ground terminals, half of which were vulnerabilities that “have the potential to result in loss of confidentiality, availability, or integrity.”49

Finally, the U.S. currently operates 33 Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites that provide geolocation, navigation, and timing data to U.S. force globally. The first GPS satellites were launched in 1978 and have since

been constantly upgraded to increase capacity and add new capabilities. The current GPS upgrade effort, GPS Block IIIA, focuses on adding additional GPS navigation signals, for both civilian and military use, and making the U.S. GPS constellation less vulnerable to enemy disruption through increased encryption and anti-jamming capabilities. Despite these additions, the current U.S. GPS constellation remains vulnerable to Chinese and Russian jamming and spoofing.50

Early Warning Radar The United States employs several radars that work in conjunction with U.S. space-based assets to provide early warning and track ballistic missile launches. In the event of a foreign ballistic missile attack, the launch would likely be first detected by either the DSP or SBIR in space, which would then cue several different groundbased radar systems.

The longest-range ground based early warning are the three 3000-mile range Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) systems located at Beale AFB, California; Thule AFB, Greenland; and RAF Flyingdales, United Kingdom. The UEWR’s primary mission is track and classify objects as threatening or nonthreatening, and then cue other sensors and interceptors.51 The 2000-mile range Cobra Dane Radar stationed at Shemya Island in Alaska performs a similar role to UEWR, but with some differences. Cobra Dane is able to more accurately classify targets than UEWR because it operates at a higher (L) frequency than the UEWR (UHF). However, Cobra Dane has a more limited observation angle due to only having a singular radar panel compared to UEWR’s multiple radar panels.52

These long-range early warning radar systems then cue other radar systems such as the TPY-2 X-band Radar integrated with the U.S. Army’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)53 and the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) / AN/SPY-6 aboard the Flight III Arleigh Burke Guided Missile Destroyers. These radars then generate tracks from which U.S. forces can intercept ballistic missiles. Of note, the AMDR AN/SPY-6 aboard the Arleigh Burkes are not a purely defensive capability, as its active electronically scanned array (AESA) can be used to blind the adversary’s radars by emitting high-powered radio waves in a tight beam.54

Nuclear Command and Control  In the event of nuclear attack, the United States has two aircraft, the E-4B and E-6 Mercury, designed to ensure the National Command Authority (NCA) retains situational awareness and command and control (C&C) capabilities. The E-4B, serves as National Emergency Airborne Command Post for the President, Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and is hardened against nuclear attacks and the resulting electromagnetic pulses. Furthermore, the E-4B allows for worldwide communication, to include communicating with the E-6 Mercury, which fulfils the Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) mission to launch U.S. 2nd strike capabilities. \[55\]

The E-6 receives orders from Looking Glass,and verifies and retransmits the Emergency Action Message (EAM) to the surviving nuclear forces to launch a second strike. The E-6 Mercury is capable of operate a wide-range of frequencies to prevent adversaries from jamming the EAM.

Cyber Domain One of the most difficult challenges for U.S. military planners going forward is that while the U.S. has extensive ISR capabilities, they generate more data than human analysts are ever capable of analyzing. To attempt to solve this problem, the Department of Defense has several artificial intelligence efforts (AI) underway that aim to improve U.S. signals and images processing capabilities by rapidly processing massive caches of raw satellite and imagery data to identify objects of interest. These programs use machine learning algorithms, which are trained using an iterative process, to identify the specific features and patterns correlated with an object of interest. The AI algorithms are then able to search through the satellite and imagery data faster than any human could ever hope to with a high-degree of confidence. U.S. researchers were able to train an AI program to locate SAM sites in southeastern China in 42 minutes with a 90 percent accuracy, compared to the 60 hours it took novice imagery analysts.56

The U.S. has several AI efforts in this space underway, including Project Maven and a classified pilot program focused on tracking the North Korean nuclear missile program. Project Maven focuses on using AI and machine learning to help intelligence analysts identify objects of interest from the moving and still imagery generated by the UAS fleet.57 While the exact mission of the pilot program  focused on North Korea is classified, it is believed to focus on leveraging AI to monitor the North Korean nuclear program using satellite imagery to track mobile launchers which can be difficult for human analysts to locate and track in real-time.58

How Are All These Systems Integrated? The United States’ military superiority does not come from any singular weapon system or platform, but its ability to integrate multiple C4ISR capabilities into a systems-of-systems approach that translates strategic situational awareness into kinetic and non-kinetic fires. The Navy’s CEC/NFIC-CA capability is perhaps the best example of how several strategic situational awareness systems, sensors, and platforms are integrated into a reconnaissance-strike complex with potentially devastating effect. If the United States wanted to target an adversary’s capital ships it could send a stealthy F-35 to penetrate the enemy’s air defense undetected, relay the enemy’s location back to the carrier strike group, who could then fire long-range anti-surface missiles at the enemy’s capital ship without needing to get close.

Military capabilities do not develop in a vacuum and just as U.S. military planners recognized the value of integrating multiple systems, sensors, and platforms into a reconnaissance-strike complex, so too have American competitors. The Chinese and Russians in particular have developed sophisticated A2/AD capabilities that threaten to disrupt, degrade, or destroy essential U.S. C4ISR enabling capabilities. These advances have forced military planners to re-think fundamental assumptions from the last thirty years about the nearguaranteed availability of C4ISR capabilities. Instead of establishing theatre-wide strategic situational awareness superiority (i.e. U.S. operations in the 1991 Gulf War or Afghanistan and Iraq), the United States might only be capable of establishing temporary windows of C4ISR superiority for U.S. forces to operate from. U.S. military forces would work within these temporary windows of superiority to dis-integrate enemy A2/AD systems and eventually re-establish theatre-wide strategic situational awareness superiority, but this requires fundamental changes in the way U.S. training, doctrine, and force structures.59

Concluding Assessments: The United States has considerable strategic situational awareness capabilities, but it will likely never enjoy the same level of unparalleled dominance that it held at the end of the Cold War. Adversaries like China and Russia recognized the importance of U.S. strategic situational awareness supremacy and have worked to catch the United States by developing their own strategic situational awareness capabilities, as well as platforms and systems that disrupt or destroy the United States’ capabilities.  While the United States still retains an overall advantage, particularly in key areas such as undersea warfare and theatre battlefield management, China and Russia are rapidly catching up to current U.S. capabilities in these key areas and have even surpassed U.S. capabilities in some areas like electronic warfare and counter-space. Moving forward, the challenge for DoD is going to be developing more resilient systems and longer-range capabilities that can disrupt, degrade, and destroy the Russian and Chinese situational awareness capabilities.
