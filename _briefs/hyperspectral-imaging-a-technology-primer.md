* Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a type of remote sensing that is particularly useful for determining the composition of an object.


* In conjunction with other remote sensing and data collecting techniques, it can be used to identify a country’s fixed strategic sites, for example, WMD production facilities or camouflaged military assets.
* Hyperspectral imaging sensors can be deployed on a variety of platforms, including manned and unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites.
* The level of risk introduced when using HSI is platform and deployment-dependent. In most cases, HSI can improve situational awareness without negatively impacting stability.
