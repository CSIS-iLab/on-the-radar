# On the Radar

The website for the On the Radar study by the CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI) program. It is built on the [CSIS Jekyll Starter](https://github.com/CSIS-iLab/csis-jekyll-starter) that utilizes gulp, Sass, Autoprefixer, PostCSS, Webpack, imagemin, and Browsersync to speed-up development.

## Forestry to Tina Migration

This site was built using Forestry as the CMS. However, Forestry was sunsetted in April 2023, so it will need to be migrated to TinaCMS or another CMS if the program wishes to actively use the site again. This process was started in April 2023, but the decision to archive the site was made before the site was migrated. To see the progress of the migration, you can view the `tina-migration` branch.

### Branching

When modifying the code base, always make a new branch. Unless it's necessary to do otherwise, all branches should be created off of `master`.

Branches should use the following naming conventions:

| Branch type               | Name                                                      | Example                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| New Feature               | `feature/<short description of feature>`                  | `feature/header-navigation` |
| Bug Fixes                 | `bug/<short description of bug>`                          | `bug/mobile-navigation`     |
| Documentation             | `docs/<short description of documentation being updated>` | `docs/readme`               |
| Code clean-up/refactoring | `refactor/<short description>`                            | `refactor/apply-linting`    |
| Content Updates           | `content/<short description of content>`                  | `content/add-new-posts`     |

When ready to merge, submit a Pull Request into `master`. All code will be reviewed by the lead developer on the project before being merged into `master`.

### Commit Messages

Write clear and concise commit messages describing the changes you are making and why. If there are any issues associated with the commit, include the issue # in the commit title.

### CSS Styles

- This project uses the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) naming convention.
- This project uses [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io) to maintain a consistent code style. Errors are flagged in the console during development and can be automatically fixed by running `npm run stylelint-fix`.
