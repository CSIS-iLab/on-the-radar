  about_this_study: The Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI) at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) aims to build and sustain a networked community of young nuclear experts from the miltiary, national labratories, industry, academia, and policy communities. For this project, PONI has partnered with the Nuclear Policy Working Group (NPWG) at the University of California-Berkeley to study how rapid technology developments—including artificial intelligence, robotics, and advanced sensing—are expected to reshape situational awareness, crisis management, and strategic warning on the conventional battlefield, introducing new and complex risks to strategic stability in the nuclear domain.
