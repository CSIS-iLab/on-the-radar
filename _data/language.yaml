  about_description: On the Radar provides analysis on emerging technologies that
    are expected to reshape situational awareness across the spectrum of conflict,
    and examines the implications of these technologies for nuclear strategic stability.
    It is a product of a two-year research collaboration between the Project on Nuclear
    Issues (PONI) at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and
    the Nuclear Policy Working Group (NPWG) at the University California Berkeley,
    funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

    title: Does this matter?
    desc: |
      The emerging ecosystem defies previous limitations on speed, precision, and resiliency, as well as the quantity and quality of highly detailed information. It can improve confidence, increase insights, and expand warning times.

      However, this new ecosystem may also introduce new risks, potentially undermining crisis stability by increasing the chance of first-mover incentive and miscalculation.
    sections:
    - title: First-Mover incentive
      desc: The quantity and quality of information as well as its predictive nature
        can create increased pressure for offensive action.
    - title: Miscalculation
      desc: The fast pace at which large volumes of information can be relayed, the
        networked and **blended*** nature of the systems, and the method of collection
        can increase the risk that intentions can be misunderstood and responses unnecessarily
        escalatory.

        and nuclear capabilities"

    title: How to navigate this project
    desc: This project examines how emerging technologies are rapidly reshaping U.S.
      strategic situational awareness and the implications of these technologies for
      strategic stability during crises between nuclear-armed states.
